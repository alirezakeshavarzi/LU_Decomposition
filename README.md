This program takes a matrix as input and returns two matrices L and U as output.

These matrices are the result of LU decomposition,
which is a method of matrix factorization.

LU decomposition splits a matrix A into two matrices L and U,
such that A = LU. L is a lower triangular matrix and U is an upper triangular matrix.

This means that all the entries above the main diagonal of L and below the main diagonal of U are zero.

LU decomposition can be useful for
solving systems of linear equations,
finding the inverse or determinant of a matrix,
or performing other matrix operations.
